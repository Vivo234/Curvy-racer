# Curvy-racer
This code is a simple implementation of a 2D racing game using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The player controls a car that moves on a road, and the goal is to avoid crashing into other cars or obstacles.

The code starts by defining some variables to store game elements such as the canvas element, the context for 2D drawing, the image for the car, its initial position and speed, and some road parameters such as width, color, length, and curvature. It also initializes an array to store the road segments.

Then, it generates the road segments by looping over the total number of segments, assigning a curve value to each one based on its index, and storing its start and end positions.

Next, it handles keyboard input by adding an event listener to the document that checks for arrow key presses and updates the car position accordingly.

The game loop function is defined next. This function is called repeatedly by the requestAnimationFrame method and updates the game state, clears the canvas, moves the road segments and draws them, updates the player segment based on the car position, and finally draws the car image.

Finally, the game loop is started by calling the requestAnimationFrame method and passing in the gameLoop function.

In summary, this code is a basic implementation of a 2D racing game using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, where the player controls a car and avoids obstacles on a curved road. It demonstrates the use of canvas drawing methods, keyboard input handling, and game loop animation using requestAnimationFrame.
